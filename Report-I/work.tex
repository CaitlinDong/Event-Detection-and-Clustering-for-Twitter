\section{\uppercase{Work Done So Far}}
In recent years, a lot of work has been done in mining hot/trending topics from Twitter stream. Twitter itself shows Trending Topics in its feed. [cite] have proposed extensions to this framework by classifying Trending Topics on Twitter using text-based and network-based classifiers. Recently, the focus in literature has shifted beyond the identification of trending topics; the problem of real-world event detection using social media has started receiving overwhelming attention. Researchers have explored the domain of event identification using social media updates, specifically Twitter. While some efforts have focused upon event detection in general [cite], other efforts have been directed towards detection of particular class of events such as earthquakes [cite], news reports [cite]. To this end, numerous techniques have been exploited. While [cite] have explored ensemble-based clustering methods for learning similarity metrics for clustering related tweets, [cite] have focused on online identification of events using classification techniques. One special technique which has gained our attention, and which we have been exploring is using Topic Models on Twitter data for detection of events.
